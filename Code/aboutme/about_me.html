                    <p>My name is Kyle Davies, and I am from San Jose, CA.
                    I am a Computer Science major, I love playing games with friends.
                    I am engaged to be married in December, I have 2 nieces that are adorable.
                    I am currently working for the IT service desk. I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science.</p>
                    <p>I love the environment here and the people that come with it.
                    I think that one of the advantages is that a lot of places are using some form of Web Design in their daily jobs, especially with today needing online communication for many jobs.
                    I am taking this course because I love to code, and WDD is a more visual way to see that your code is working.
                    I hope to get a job in helping push forward the computer world in that we can do things that were just immagination a few years ago.
                    I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for 21 years.</p>
                    <p class="white">My favorite quote from a leader in the Church is:<br>
